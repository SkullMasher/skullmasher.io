## Credits to open source

This project was originaly a simple single page website built with the [yeoman gulp generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp).

The CSS reset is done with the help of the famous [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css) project.

I use [KNACSS](https://github.com/alsacreations/KNACSS) to help me write css. Shoutout to Alsacreation for all the great ressources they share with the web.

A huge thanks to all the contributors behind these awesome project.
